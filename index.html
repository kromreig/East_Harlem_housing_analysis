        <div class="title"> <br/><br/> <br/>Rent Stabilization</div>
        55% of New York City's rental housing is regulated--1.2 million apartments with 2.8 million tenants. Rent stabilization limits rent increases to percentages mandated each year by the city's Rent Guidelines Board, and provides some additional protections for tenants. These rules can be circumvented through loopholes including vacancy decontrol. A beleaguered rent-stabilized portfolio is an attractive investment, then, if the landlord can get tenants out of their apartments fast enough to convert them to market-rate rental units.
        <br/>Rent stabilization will expire on June 15, 2019 if the laws are not renewed.  </section>
    <!--Each time the user gets to a new section, a new function is triggered in the D3 graphics!! The headlines correspond to the setupSection function array value in the sections.js file-->
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">An Attractive Investment</div>
        <br/>
        The difference between the depressed, stabilized rents and the market-rate rents is often dramatic.
        <br/>
        The strategy to buy rent-stabilized apartments means that they sometimes may use illegal and frequently unethical means to get tenants out of the stabilized apartments, since one of the only ways to destabilize an apartment is when there is a vacancy.
        <br/>
        But rent stabilization means tenants are afforded some extra legal rights, including the ability to form a tenant association.

        If every building in East Harlem were a square, <span style="color: red">49 </span> of those squares are owned by Emerald Equity.<br/>
        The portfolio was originally consolidated in the 80s under Steven Kessner.
        <br/>Colloquially, it's known as the Dawnay, Day Portfolio.<br/>

        <div class="title">Where does Emerald Equity fit in?</br></div>
        <br/>
        The complaints made by tenants from Emerald Equity's buildings are just a small picture of tenant distress in East Harlem.
        <br/>
        But Emerald Equity only has <span style="color: red">49 buildings </span> out of a total 3078 in East Harlem. Those <span style="color: red">49 buildings </span> contain <span style="color: red">1449 apartments </span> out of the 51170 apartments in all of East Harlem.

        <div class="title">It's bad in East Harlem...<br/> but for Emerald Equity tenants, it's worse than ever.</div>
        <br/>
        This is how many complaints per unit Emerald Equity has, compared to the per-unit rate in all of East Harlem.</b>

        This was found by combining unique BBLs with unitsres from Pluto in both Harlem and Emerald Equity.

        <div class="title">HPD Class A Violations</div>
        <br/>
        Housing Preservation and Development violation classes are confusing: Class A is the least serious, and Class C is the most serious.
        <br/>
        Class A violations are non-hazardous. There's been a marked uptick since Emerald Equity's purchase of the buildings in December, 2016.
        <br/>
        Examples of Class A Violations:<br/>
        -No peephole in the entrance door of the dwelling unit;
        <br/>
        -No street number on the front of the dwelling
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">HPD Class B Violations</div>
        <br/>
        Class B violations are more hazardous than A, less hazardous than C.
        <br/>
        Examples of Class B Violations:
        <br/>
        -Inadequate lighting facilities for public halls or stairs;
        <br/>
        -Owner has not provided an approved smoke detector in dwelling unit;
        <br/>
        -Unlawful bars or gates on windows opening to fire escapes
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">HPD Class C Violations</div>
        <br/>
        Class C violations are immediately hazardous.
        <br/>
        Examples of Class C Violations:
        <br/>
        Inadequate supply of heat and hot water;
        <br/>
        Rodents;
        <br/>
        Peeling lead paint in dwellings where a child under 7 resides;
        <br/>
        Broken or defective plumbing fixtures;

        Department of Buildings complaints are complaints that are issued by city inspectors. They are generally more serious in nature.

        They are overrepresented by average. For every thousand units, Emerald Equity units have many more complaints than the East Harlem average.

        This has been true historically, as the data shows, but has worsened dramatically since the portfolio was purchased by Emerald Equity.

        Lead, Mold, Gas.
        <br/>Lead is shown in red.
        <br/>
        The uptick in gas and lead complaints are often related with new construction in recently vacated apartments.

        <br/> Hastily done construction means lots of dust, filled with lead from decades of paint, and damage to gas lines.
