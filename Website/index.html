        <div class="title">Rent Stabilization</div>
        About three-eighths of the New York City's housing is rent-regulated--1.1 million apartments with 2.7 million tenants. Strict rent control applies in 71,000 apartments built before 1947. The rest are rent-stabilized, which means rent increases are limited to percentages mandated each year by the city's Rent Guidelines Board. This means there is a large difference in these rents and the market rates. That makes for an attractive investment for real estate developers, if you can get tenants out of their apartments so those apartments can be deregulated.
        <br/>Rent control and rent stabilization will expire on June 15 of 2019 if they are not renewed, and the protections and rights that rent-stabilized tenants have will be gone.

        <div class="title">A Good Investment</div>
        Emerald Equity's strategy to buy rent-stabilized apartments means that they have to use illegal and frequently unethical means to get tenants out of the stabilized apartments, since the only way to destabilize an apartment is when there is a vacancy.

        But the nature of these apartments means tenants are afforded some extra legal rights, including the ability to form a tenant association. Buildings 1661 Park, 231 E 117, and 322 E 117 already have tenant associations and are directly responding to the abuse from Emerald Equity by: lawsuit with Manhattan Legal Services, organizing with UHAB and other local groups, as well as inter-building canvassing and meetings addressing Emerald Equity directly.

        <div class="title">Complaints per Unit: East Harlem vs. Emerald Equity</div>
        Emerald Equity has just 49 buildings in East Harlem. It's a relatively small portion of the overall complaints, if we're talking absolute numbers.
        <br/>But if we examine complaints per unit, we see that the buildings that Emerald Equity owns have always been bad compared to the rest of East Harlem-- and they've gotten much worse since Emerald Equity bought them in December 2016.

        <div class="title">DOB Complaints</div>
        Unpermitted constructions have spiked since Emerald Equity. This is one of the indicators of tenant displacement: by doing bothersome construction that is unpermitted and illegal, landlords can often cause the tenants to move out when the construction gets too annoying. In 231 E 117, illegal construction caused the gas for the whole building to get shut off, and the tenants formed a tenant association.

        My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.

        The world may never know, or care, but hopefully these insights improve my speaking in 2015. Though preliminary results aren't looking so good.
