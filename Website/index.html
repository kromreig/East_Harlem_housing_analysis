        <div class="title">Rent Stabilization</div>
        About three-eighths of the New York City's housing is rent-regulated--1.1 million apartments with 2.7 million tenants. Strict rent control applies in 71,000 apartments built before 1947. The rest are rent-stabilized, which means rent increases are limited to percentages mandated each year by the city's Rent Guidelines Board. This means there is a large difference in these rents and the market rates. That makes for an attractive investment for real estate developers, if you can get tenants out of their apartments so those apartments can be deregulated.
        <br/>Rent control and rent stabilization will expire on June 15 of 2019 if they are not renewed, and the protections and rights that rent-stabilized tenants have will be gone.

        <div class="title">A Good Investment</div>
        Private Equity's strategy to buy rent-stabilized apartments means that they sometimes may use illegal and frequently unethical means to get tenants out of the stabilized apartments, since one of the only ways to destabilize an apartment is when there is a vacancy.

        But the nature of rent-stabilized apartments means tenants are afforded some extra legal rights, including the ability to form a tenant association.

        <div class="title">The Portfolio</div>
        Emerald Equity has just 49 buildings in their portfolio in East Harlem.<br/>
        The portfolio was originally consolidated in the 80s under Steven Kessner, notorious slumlord. Since then, it has been passed around by various hedgefunds, changes which tenants say were hard to keep track of.
        <br/>Colloquially, it's known as the Dawnay, Day Portfolio.<br/>
        <br/>Buildings 1661 Park, 231 E 117, and 322 E 117 already have tenant associations.

        <div class="title">Emerald Equity Complaints vs All of East Harlem: Totals</div>
        In the greater context of East Harlem, the number of complaints tenants have made from Emerald Equity is fairly small.

        But Emerald Equity only has 49 buildings out of a total 3078 in East Harlem.

        Let's take a look at how many complaints per unit Emerald Equity has, compared to the per-unit rate in all of East Harlem.

        HPD complaints dealing with Pests have also all increased.

        <div class="title">DOB Complaints</div>
        Unpermitted constructions have spiked since Emerald Equity. This is one of the indicators of tenant displacement: by doing bothersome construction that is unpermitted and illegal, landlords can often cause the tenants to move out when the construction gets too annoying. In 231 E 117, illegal construction caused the gas for the whole building to get shut off, and the tenants formed a tenant association.

        My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.

        The world may never know, or care, but hopefully these insights improve my speaking in 2015. Though preliminary results aren't looking so good.
