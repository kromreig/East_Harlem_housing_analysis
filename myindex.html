        <div class="title" style="text-align:left;"> <br/><br/> <br/>Rent Stabilization</div>
        Fifty-five percent of New York City's rental housing is regulated in some way--1.2 million apartments with 2.8 million tenants. Rent stabilization limits rent increases to percentages mandated each year by the city's Rent Guidelines Board, and provides some additional protections for tenants, including an offer of a renewal lease. These rules can be circumvented through loopholes including a vacancy bonus. A beleaguered rent-stabilized portfolio is an attractive investment, then, if the landlord can get tenants out of their apartments fast enough to convert them to market-rate rental units.
        <br/>Rent stabilization will expire on June 15, 2019 if the laws are not renewed.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title" style="text-align:left;">An Attractive Investment</div>
        <br/>
        The difference between the depressed, stabilized rents and the market-rate rents is often dramatic.
        <br/>
        The strategy to buy rent-stabilized apartments means that they sometimes may use illegal and frequently unethical means to get tenants out of the stabilized apartments, since one of the only ways to destabilize an apartment is when there is a vacancy.

        <br/>
        The complaints made by tenants from Emerald Equity's buildings are just a small picture of tenant discontent in East Harlem.
        <br/>
        But Emerald Equity only has <span style="color: #ef233c">49 buildings </span> out of a total 3078 in East Harlem. Those buildings contain <span style="color: #ef233c">1449 apartments </span> out of the 51170 apartments in all of East Harlem.

        <div class="title" style="text-align:left;">HPD Class A Violations</div>
        Housing Preservation and Development violation classes are confusing: Class A is the least serious, and Class C is the most serious.
        <br/>
        Examples of Class A Violations:<br/>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>No peephole in the entrance door of the dwelling unit</li>
        <li>No street number on the front of the dwelling</li>
      </ul>

        </section>
        <section class="step">
        <div class="title" style="text-align:left;">Housing Preservation and Development Class B Violations</div>
        Class B violations are more hazardous than A, less hazardous than C.
        Examples of Class B Violations:<br/>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Inadequate lighting facilities for public halls or stairs;</li>
        <li>Owner has not provided an approved smoke detector in dwelling unit</li>
        <li>Unlawful bars or gates on windows opening to fire escapes</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title" style="text-align:left;">Housing Preservation and Development Class C Violations</div>
        Class C violations are immediately hazardous.
        <br/>
        Examples of Class C Violations:
        <br/>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Inadequate supply of heat and hot water;
        Rodents</li>
        
        <li>Peeling lead paint in dwellings where a child under 7 resides</li>
        <li>Broken or defective plumbing fixtures</li>
      </ul>

        <div class="title" style="text-align:left;">Total Housing Preservation and Development Litigations</div>

        Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) initiates actions against landlords of privately-owned buildings to enforce legal standards of maintenance and repair.
        <br/>
        While the buildings Emerald Equity owns are just a small part of the total HPD litigations in East Harlem...

      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title" style="text-align:left;">Average HPD Litigations</div>
        Lawsuits in the Emerald Equity portfolio are much more frequent than in the rest of East Harlem.
        <br/>
        The buildings have seen 74 new lawsuits initiated since Emerald Equity acquired the buildings: 17 are still pending.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title" style="text-align:left;">Department of Buildings Violations Total</div>
        Department of Buildings violations are generally more serious in nature, and where .
        <br/>
        And while Emerald Equity is only a small fraction of the total Department of Buildings complaints in East Harlem...
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title" style="text-align:left;">Department of Buildings Violations</div>
        <br/>
        For every thousand units, Emerald Equity units have many more violations than the East Harlem average.

        This has been true historically, as the data shows, but has worsened dramatically since the portfolio was purchased by Emerald Equity.

        <div class="title" style="text-align:left;">Categories of Housing Preservation and Development Violations</div>
        <br/>
        Gas and lead complaints often related with new construction in recently vacated apartments.
        <br/> Hastily done construction means lots of dust, filled with lead in older buildings, and damage to gas lines. Repairs that are not done properly encourage mold.
